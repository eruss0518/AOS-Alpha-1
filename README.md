After downloading run the program and it will error out but create 2 new folders in the Documents folder
Once it fails the first time, place the file named 'boop' into the importFolder
Run the program once more and you can see how the programm is supposed to run.
The txt file named boop was created using the export list feature from the warhammer age of sigmar application for 4th edition, please feel free to test this and let me know how it goes
The next phase:
  -Process more than one list
  -Calculate the the units performance throughout the game
  -Create a save file and secondaty database to track the units performance
